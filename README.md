# Image-Filtering-Line-Detection

This is a project created to put image filters on a .bmp file.

Usage: ./filter -option <inputImage.bmp> <outputImage.bmp>

  Where -option is:
    -g greyscale
    -r reverse
    -b blur
    -e edges (line detection algorithm)

  and inputImage.bmp and outputImage.bmp are the paths to the .bmp file you want to filter and have output respectively.

See helpers.c for my filtering functions.
